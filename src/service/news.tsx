The statement adds to growing support for the legalization of international crypto payments in Russia amid financial restrictions imposed over its invasion of Ukraine.</strong></p>
<h2>Top Financial Regulator in Russia Welcomes International Crypto Payments</h2>
<p>The Federal Financial Monitoring Service of the Russian Federation, also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosfinmonitoring" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rosfinmonitoring</a>, fully accepts that cryptocurrencies can be employed for settlements with foreign partners, Yury Chikhanchin, director of the regulatory body has stated.</p>
<p>Speaking in the Federation Council, the upper house of Russian parliament, Chikhanchin emphasized that payments with digital assets inside Russia are prohibited by law. The country&#x2019;s current legislation bans &#x201C;money surrogates.&#x201D;</p>
<p>However, under certain conditions, such payments may well be used in international trade, Chikhanchin said. The high-ranking official believes this can help businesses oriented towards exporting Russian products. Quoted by the Bits.media crypto news outlet, he also noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>If the supply chain is controlled, then this is quite acceptable.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yury Chikhanchin further emphasized that in order to take advantage of cryptocurrency payments, Russian companies need to know to whom exactly they are exchanging the digital currencies.</p>
<p>The regulator revealed that his department has developed and already launched a special information system for tracking crypto transactions. It allows financial authorities to identify both the sender and the recipient of funds and has been used already in some investigations.</p>

<p>The debate over the future of cryptocurrencies in Russia is still ongoing. A new bill &#x201C;On Digital Currency&#x201D; is expected to introduce more comprehensive rules for crypto transactions after the law &#x201C;On Digital Financial Assets&#x201D; regulated only some aspects of the crypto market.</p>
<p>The idea to use cryptocurrencies in international settlements has been gaining support amid mounting Western sanctions over Russia&#x2019;s military intervention in Ukraine. At the same time, most government institutions in Moscow agree that the ruble should remain the only legal tender in the country.</p>
<p>While the Bank of Russia, a strong opponent of the free circulation of cryptocurrencies, recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-payments-possible-if-they-dont-penetrate-russias-financial-system-central-bank-says/">signaled</a> it could back the legalization of crypto payments that don&#x2019;t penetrate Russia&#x2019;s financial system, the lower house of Russian parliament recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russian-state-duma-adopts-law-banning-payments-with-digital-financial-assets/">adopted</a> a law banning domestic payments with digital financial assets.</p>

<h2>Fed Vice Chair Brainard on Crypto Regulation</h2>
<p>Lael Brainard, the vice chair of the Board of the Federal Reserve Governors, talked about crypto regulation and decentralized finance (defi) Friday at a Bank of England conference in London.</p>
<p>She began by referencing recent volatility in the crypto market, stating that it &#x201C;has exposed serious vulnerabilities in the crypto financial system.&#x201D; She added that both traditional and crypto financial systems are susceptible to leverage, settlement, opacity, maturity, and liquidity transformation risks.</p>
<p>Noting that &#x201C;Innovation has the potential to make financial services faster, cheaper, and more inclusive and to do so in ways that are native to the digital ecosystem,&#x201D; Brainard stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is important that the foundations for sound regulation of the crypto financial system be established now before the crypto ecosystem becomes so large or interconnected that it might pose risks to the stability of the broader financial system.</p></blockquote>
<p>Emphasizing the need for national and international cooperation, the Federal Reserve vice chair opined: &#x201C;The recent turbulence and losses among retail investors in crypto highlight the urgent need to ensure compliance with existing regulations and to fill any gaps where regulations or enforcement may need to be tailored &#x2014; for instance, for decentralized protocols and platforms.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Brainard continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>Future financial resilience will be greatly enhanced if we ensure the regulatory perimeter encompasses the crypto financial system and reflects the principle of same risk, same disclosure, same regulatory outcome.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Fed vice chair added that a U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC) could help financial stability &#x201C;by providing the neutral trusted settlement layer in the future crypto financial system.&#x201D;</p>
<p>On Thursday, the U.S. Treasury Department delivered a framework for international engagement on crypto assets to President Joe Biden as directed in the executive order he issued back in March. The Treasury stressed the importance of collaborating with international allies to develop global crypto standards to regulate digital assets.</p>

His analysis shows that bitcoin is cheap but ether could be even cheaper. &#x201C;Ethereum could be close to a bottom,&#x201D; he added.</strong></p>
<h2>Fidelity&#x2019;s Director on Bitcoin and Ether Price Outlook</h2>
<p>Jurrien Timmer, director of Global Macro in Fidelity Investments&#x2019; global asset allocation division, shared his bitcoin and ether price analysis in a series of tweets Friday. Timmer specializes in global macro strategy and active asset allocation. He joined Fidelity 27 years ago as a technical research analyst.</p>
<p>He explained why bitcoin is cheap. &#x201C;I use the price per millions of non-zero addresses as an estimate for bitcoin&#x2019;s valuation, and the chart below shows that valuation is all the way back to 2013 levels, even though price is only back to 2020 levels,&#x201D; he detailed, emphasizing:</p>
<blockquote><p>In other words, bitcoin is cheap.</p></blockquote>

<p>&#x201C;At its recent low of $17,600, bitcoin is now below even my more conservative S-curve model, which is based on the internet adoption curve,&#x201D; the Fidelity director added.</p>
<p>Timmer noted that it is clear from looking at Bitcoin&#x2019;s network growth that &#x201C;the adoption curve is tracking the more asymptotic internet adoption curve, rather than the more exponential mobile phone curve.&#x201D; He continued: &#x201C;Per Metcalfe&#x2019;s Law, slower network growth suggests a more modest price appreciation.&#x201D;</p>
<p>However, &#x201C;based on a simple power regression line, Bitcoin&#x2019;s network appears to be intact,&#x201D; the director opined. &#x201C;That continued growth in Bitcoin&#x2019;s network, combined with lower prices, means that bitcoin&#x2019;s valuation is coming down.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The Fidelity director of Global Macro proceeded to share his ether price outlook, tweeting:</p>
<blockquote><p>If bitcoin is cheap, then perhaps ethereum is cheaper. If <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> is where <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> was four years ago, then the analog below suggests that ethereum could be close to a bottom.</p></blockquote>

<p>At the time of writing, bitcoin is trading at $21,584, up 11% over the past seven days but down 29% over the past 30 days. Ether is trading at $1,217, up 14% over the last seven days but down 32% over the past 30 days.</p>

<h2>U.S. Treasury Secretary Delivers Crypto Framework to Biden</h2>
<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury published a <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0854">fact sheet</a> titled &#x201C;Framework for International Engagement on Digital Assets&#x201D; Thursday.</p>
<p>It states that the Secretary of the Treasury has delivered to President Joe Biden &#x201C;a framework for interagency engagement with foreign counterparts and in international fora as directed in the President&#x2019;s executive order on Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets.&#x201D; Biden&#x2019;s executive order on crypto regulation was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biden-signs-executive-order-establishing-national-crypto-policy-across-6-key-priorities/">issued</a> on March 9.</p>
<p>The framework calls for the U.S. and its foreign allies to collaborate to create international standards for regulating crypto assets. The Treasury described:</p>
<blockquote><p>Uneven regulation, supervision, and compliance across jurisdictions creates opportunities for arbitrage and raises risks to financial stability and the protection of consumers, investors, businesses, and markets.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#x201C;Inadequate anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regulation, supervision, and enforcement by other countries challenges the ability of the United States to investigate illicit digital asset transaction flows that frequently jump overseas, as is often the case in ransomware payments and other cybercrime-related money laundering,&#x201D; the department added.</p>
<p>The Treasury further explained that the U.S. must work with international partners and be a leader in the discussions on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and digital payment architectures.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Such international work should continue to address the full spectrum of issues and challenges raised by digital assets, including financial stability; consumer and investor protection, and business risks; and money laundering, terrorist financing, proliferation financing, sanctions evasion, and other illicit activities,&#x201D; the Treasury noted.</p>

<p>The fact sheet outlines key international engagements for the U.S., including with the G7 and G20 countries, the Financial Stability Board (FSB), the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), The World Bank, and other Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs).</p>
<p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s outlined in the framework is intended to ensure that, with respect to the development of digital assets, America&#x2019;s core democratic values are respected; consumers, investors, and businesses are protected; appropriate global financial system connectivity and platform and architecture interoperability are preserved; and the safety and soundness of the global financial system and international monetary system are maintained,&#x201D; the Treasury detailed.</p>

Using today&#x2019;s <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> exchange rates a block subsidy value is worth $136,625 per block and during the last 90 days, the hashrate averaged around 213.8 exahash per second (EH/s).</p>
<p>On June 8, 2022, the hashrate tapped a high of around 292.02 EH/s at block height 739,928 and today it&#x2019;s much lower at 178.44 EH/s. Statistics recorded over the last month indicate that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s hashrate slipped 26.56% lower than the average after the first week of June.</p>

<p>While <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s price is lower and hovering just above the $21K region, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> miners have caught a break during the last two DAA changes after they saw two downward adjustments. The last two DAA shifts made it 3.76% easier to find <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> blocks and the next DAA change is expected to decrease again 0.13% lower.</p>
<p>However, there&#x2019;s still 11 days left until the next DAA change and the time it takes to find 2,016 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> blocks will determine if the DAA goes up or down. Since March 3, 2022, the Bitcoin network has recorded six downward adjustments and four increases.</p>

<h2>Crunchtime: Less Than 100K Blocks Left Until the Next Block Subsidy Halving</h2>
<p>While the hashrate has slipped by 26% during the last 30 days, 4,216 block subsidy rewards were discovered by miners. Foundry USA found the most with 959 blocks found last month and around 22.75% of the global hashrate.</p>
<p>Foundry was followed by Antpool which captured 14.61% of the global hashrate and discovered 616 blocks last month. There are 14 known <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> mining pools today, and unknown hashrate or stealth miners obtained around 56 block rewards last month which equated to 1.33% of the 30-day hashrate.</p>
<p>There&#x2019;s less than 100K blocks left until the next reward halving (95,699 block away at press time) and miners will see revenues slashed in half at that point in time. The halving is expected to occur on or around April 16, 2024, which is 647 days away.</p>
<p>After that date, bitcoin miners will only get 3.123 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> per block in comparison to today&#x2019;s 6.25 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> block reward. Metrics on Saturday, June 9, 2022, indicate that mining rig profitability at $0.12 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) is low.</p>
<p>The most profitable ASIC mining rig today is the Bitmain Antminer S19 XP which produces 140 terahash per second (TH/s). The Antminer S19 XP makes an estimated $5.13 in profits with electrical costs at $0.12 per kWh.</p>

Meanwhile, there&#x2019;s now more than 13 million ethereum locked into the Beacon Chain worth $15.8 billion using today&#x2019;s prices.</strong></p>
<h2>More Than 13 Million Ether Worth $15.8 Billion Deposited Into the Ethereum 2.0 Contract</h2>
<p>This week the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> 2.0 contract has seen a total of more than 13 million <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> deposited and there are now 406,640 validators. In time, the Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) blockchain is expected to transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) chain. Currently, the network has a hybrid system of both proof-of-work (PoW) for the main chain, and PoS for the Beacon chain. At the time of writing, the <a href="https://dune.com/arch1111/eth-staking-dashboard">13,012,469</a> ether locked into the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> 2.0 contract is worth more than $15.8 billion using current <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> exchange rates.</p>
<p>The 13 million in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> stems from 76,506 depositor addresses and the aggregate represents 10.88% of the entire <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> supply today, according to Dune Analytics <a href="https://dune.com/arch1111/eth-staking-dashboard">statistics</a>. 31.73% of the share is staked via the liquid staking application Lido. Besides Lido, other large staking services include companies like Kraken, Staked.us, Stakefish, Bitcoin Suisse, and Figment. While many thought the PoS transition, otherwise known as The Merge, would possibly happen in <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/eth-co-founder-vitalik-buterin-says-the-merge-could-happen-in-august-theres-also-risk-of-delay/">August</a>, the difficulty bomb update has pushed The Merge further away.</p>

<h2>Ethereum Devs Aim to Avoid Network Degradation Due to a Premature Activation of the Difficulty Bomb</h2>
<p>On June 30, the Ethereum network updated to Gray Glacier at <a href="https://etherscan.io/block/15050000">block height 15,050,000</a> which pushes the difficulty bomb back by 100 days. &#x201C;The Gray Glacier network upgrade changes the parameters of the Ice Age/Difficulty Bomb, pushing it back by 700,000 blocks, or roughly 100 days,&#x201D; Ethereum developer Tim Beiko <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2022/06/16/gray-glacier-announcement/">disclosed</a> on June 16, 2022. &#x201C;With <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2022/05/30/ropsten-merge-announcement/">Ropsten now transitioned to proof-of-stake</a>, the difficulty bomb only affects the Ethereum mainnet. This means Gray Glacier will not be deployed on any testnet,&#x201D; he added.</p>
<p>In addition to the <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5133">delay</a>, Ethereum network fees have <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ethereum-transfer-costs-continue-to-slide-network-fees-tap-a-19-month-low/">remained low</a> and at the time of writing, the <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/ethereum-transactionfees.html#3y">average network fee</a> is 0.0018 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> or $2.16 per transaction. Today, a <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/ethereum-median_transaction_fee.html">median-sized</a> Ethereum network fee is 0.00078 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> or $0.955 per data transfer. Furthermore, since August 5, 2021, or since the implementation of EIP 1559, approximately <a href="https://dune.com/k06a/Ethereum-after-1559">2,523,831 ETH</a> worth $8.4 billion has been destroyed.</p>
<p>Essentially, the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/#difficulty-bomb">difficulty bomb</a> is a &#x201C;Planned exponential increase in <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/#pow">proof-of-work</a> <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/#difficulty">difficulty</a> setting designed to motivate the transition to <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/#pos">proof-of-stake</a>, reducing the chances of a <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/#hard-fork">fork</a>.&#x201D; EIP 5133&#x2019;s notes explain the motivation behind the delay is to &#x201C;avoid network degradation due to a premature activation of the difficulty bomb.&#x201D;</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think about Ethereum developers delaying the difficulty bomb? When do you expect Ethereum to transition to a full PoS chain? Let us know your thoughts about this subject in the comments section below. </strong></em></p>

During a telephone conversation, Celente discussed the uncertainty surrounding the global economy after governments worldwide locked down the world&#x2019;s citizens over the Covid-19 pandemic, shut down businesses and injected trillions into the economy. The discussion touches upon gold, bitcoin, the pandemic, the Ukraine-Russia war, and the Federal Reserve. The trends forecaster believes that World War III has already begun, and if people do not assemble to bolster peace in this world then we the people are doomed. Celente stressed that if people want real change, they cannot rely on hope as they need to take a stand to make it happen themselves.</strong></p>
<h2>Trend Forecaster Gerald Celente Discusses the Economy, Covid 19, Great Reset, Gold, Bitcoin and More</h2>
<p><strong>Bitcoin.com News (BCN): What do you think about the global economy and the way it is today?</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/geraldcelente">Gerald Celente</a> (GC):</strong> The <a href="https://trendsresearch.com">Trends Journal</a> had forecast this back in 2000. The reality that everybody is forgetting is that the Covid War destroyed the livelihoods of hundreds of millions, if not billions of people. The only thing they did to prevent it was to inject countless trillions of dollars of monetary methadone into the equity markets through their bond-buying schemes and keeping interest rates to negative and zero rate policy.</p>
<p>Then governments pump in countless trillions of free money to keep pumping up the economy artificially. It should have crashed &#x2014; You got some little jerks telling you: &#x201C;We&#x2019;re gonna flatten the curve, we are making up this crap! We&#x2019;re gonna lock you down. You are a non-essential piece of crap. Meanwhile, the big guys who give me money that morons and imbeciles call campaign contributions&#x201D; &#x2014; that adults call &#x201C;bribes and payoffs&#x201D; &#x2014; &#x201C;they can stay open.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;ll wipe out businesses from coast to coast around the world! Oh, you want to go to a dry cleaner now?&#x201D; In the United States, a third of them went out of business. Yeah, I wonder why? Because people are not working in the office anymore? Oh, office occupancy rate&#x2026; Depending on the numbers you see and what crap you swallow &#x2014; around 50%. You mean all the businesses that used to rely on millions and millions of commuters, can no longer rely on them and they are now out of business&#x2026; Yeah we&#x2019;re not going to write about that, as a matter of fact, what we&#x2019;re gonna do is every time there&#x2019;s a problem, we&#x2019;re gonna blame it on the pandemic.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Oh it&#x2019;s a result of the pandemic,&#x201D; they say. &#x201C;The supply chain issues are a result of the pandemic.&#x201D;</p>
<blockquote><p>That&#x2019;s not a result of the pandemic &#x2014; it&#x2019;s a result of you little political pieces of crap that shut down everything and destroyed the livelihoods of hundreds of millions. Oh, and by the way, they sucked the joy out of life and they freaked out the population. Little kids are growing up all screwed up, masked up, vaxxed up, and f***ed up. That&#x2019;s a big part of it. What people are forgetting is that this thing was going down before the Covid War began.</p></blockquote>

<p>Just look at the facts. Oh, over there in India, before Covid, what did they have like seven or nine GDP declines in a row? Oh and a place called Germany, the richest economy in Europe&#x2026; Oh, they were a fraction away from going into an official recession in 2019. You forgot about all the money that they were pumping into the repo markets. What is a repo market? The repo markets are where they give the gamblers on Wall Street and money junkies free money to go gamble. They couldn&#x2019;t give them enough. They pumped in $7 trillion from September 2019 to January 2020. Did you forget about when the stock market had its worst December in decades back in 2018? Back when Donald Trump forced the central bankster Fed head Jerome Powell to lower interest rates. He did it in January of 2019 and artificially juiced them up &#x2014; yeah that&#x2019;s right.</p>
<blockquote><p>Now they&#x2019;re raising interest rates and you are watching commodity prices collapsing one after another from corn to cotton &#x2014; It&#x2019;s across the board.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>BCN: Why is it that U.S. president Joe Biden and Fed chair Jerome Powell are not admitting the country is in a recession? Do you think they ever will admit it?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GC:</strong> For the same reason that they wouldn&#x2019;t admit that there was inflation. They are not going to admit there&#x2019;s a recession. Look at all the crap they spewed out &#x2014; They said that inflation was &#x2018;temporary,&#x2019; that it was &#x2018;transitory.&#x2019; They were making this crap up. They were not that stupid. They knew it was real. They didn&#x2019;t do it because the economies would have crashed if they pushed up interest rates. It won&#x2019;t be official until it meets the official characterization of a recession, and that&#x2019;s two-quarters of negative GDP growth. You had one negative quarter of GDP growth for Germany back then in 2019 and then during the last quarter, it was up 0.1% or something, so you cant officially call it a recession.</p>
<blockquote><p>When you look at raw material prices from corn to copper to cotton to crude, oil prices are plummeting. The slump in major industrial materials racked up its worst quarter since the panic of 08&#x2019;.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>BCN: What do you think about today&#x2019;s fiat currencies and the turbulence they face?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GC:</strong> The dollar has no real competition. It&#x2019;s as simple as that. Look at the Chinese yuan. They have a debt to GDP ratio of over 300. Are you going to go to the Japanese yen? In Japan, where they have a debt to GDP ratio of around 260 something. Are you going to go to the euro? When they are still at minus 50 basis points. When inflation in Europe is running hot at 8.6%. Now you have the euro down to its lowest since 2002. So where&#x2019;s the competition? The dollar is only staying up because there is no competition, and the Fed is raising rates quicker than everyone else.</p>
<p><strong>BCN: Do you think the Russian ruble is as strong as they say it is?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GC:</strong> It will be if energy prices stay high. If energy prices go low the ruble goes down with it.</p>
<p><strong>BCN: How long do you think the Ukraine-Russia war will last?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GC:</strong> For as long as the United States and NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) support Ukraine. Russia has already won. But it&#x2019;s a big lie to say that. You know, the <a href="https://trendsresearch.com">Trends Journal</a> wrote about this before the war began. We said that Ukraine should negotiate the issues that Russia is bringing up. Among them was the violation of the Minsk agreement that was put together by France and Britain after the separatist regions of the Donbas region &#x2014; They were going to be a separatist but not a separate country. It&#x2019;s been reported that Ukrainians killed an estimated 15,000 of them. The other issue [is] about them not joining NATO. And none of these issues were discussed.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Remember, the Presstitutes in the US reporting on the Russian invasion probably still can&#x2019;t point to Ukraine on a map</p>
<p>&#x2014; Gerald Celente (@geraldcelente) <a href="https://twitter.com/geraldcelente/status/1545498989671239680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 8, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>So we said they should discuss them because they are not going to beat the Russians. Once upon a time, there was a guy by the name of Napoleon Bonaparte&#x2026; He left Poland with 422,000 troops to attack Moscow. The famous chart. Bonaparte came back with 10,000 troops. Once upon a time, not too long ago, there was a thing called World War II. Adolf Hitler lost Operation Barbarossa which killed an estimated 25 million to 30 million Russians. Who were the first ones to beat the Germans in World War II? The Russians. So now you have the country of Ukraine of 40 million fighting Russia, a country with 140 million and an advanced military. And they are going to beat them? And the United States is going to help them win? When the U.S. hasn&#x2019;t won a war since World War II. Despite killing millions of people and spending countless trillions of dollars.</p>
<blockquote><p>So they should have negotiated for peace before it happened so now Russia controls over 20% of the country.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>BCN: What are your thoughts on gold right now as a safe haven?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GC:</strong> I thought gold would&#x2019;ve gone much higher. The only reason why gold is going down is because of the robust dollar. Which to me makes absolutely no sense because when economies crash, and this goes back to the panic of &#x2019;08, you saw gold spike. Gold is going down now, but it&#x2019;s getting very close to a breakout point. Again, you have a number of reasons why gold is going down, and one of them, we just mentioned, which is all the global fiat currencies going down. And gold and other commodities are priced in dollars. So now you need more of your currencies that are declining to buy this stuff, and you can&#x2019;t afford it.</p>
<p>But we see gold, at the <a href="https://trendsresearch.com">Trends Journal</a>, as do I, as the ultimate safe-haven asset. There is no other, it&#x2019;s been going on since the beginning of recorded history and gold is not going to go away. The other reality is that the markets are rigged. If you don&#x2019;t believe me. Then go back to 2019, when the bankster gang JPMorgan Chase was fined a measly $900 million dollars for rigging the precious metals markets. This, by the way, is the same Jamie Dimon group that has been convicted of five felonies &#x2014; JPMorgan Chase. But they don&#x2019;t go to jail. Like you or I, if we went ten miles over the speed limit and were 0.1% over the alcohol limit, and they had us handcuffed. No, they don&#x2019;t go to jail. They pay a little fine.</p>
<blockquote><p>In the new world order, where the &#x2018;Bigs&#x2019; own everything, it&#x2019;s prosecution to the fullest for we the plantation workers of Slavelandia, and little arrogant boys like Jamie Dimon get a slap on the wrist. For committing major felonies. So the markets are rigged. Look at the crap they have like a plunge protection team. &#x2018;Oh the markets are going down too sharply, let&#x2019;s pump &#x2019;em back up! We&#x2019;re the New York Fed &#x2014; We got a desk right there on Wall Street.&#x2019; That&#x2019;s all they are, by the way, daddy&#x2019;s boys and girls, arrogant members of the club &#x2014; It&#x2019;s all one big club and you ain&#x2019;t in it, said the great George Carlin.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>BCN: What are your thoughts about bitcoin?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GC:</strong> It&#x2019;s a gambler&#x2019;s game. The Trends Journal gave the breakout numbers in bitcoin and we were positive on it, to say where the upside is and where the downside is. It&#x2019;s a new thing, and as long as the big investors stay in it, it won&#x2019;t collapse. If the big investors pull out &#x2014; then it&#x2019;s going to be a rough road. As we were saying back in 2017, in the Trends Journal, we said that the greatest danger to cryptocurrencies is when governments ban them. And then China did it and you saw bitcoin prices plummet when China did that and then it came back.</p>
<p>Number two, at some point in the not-too-distant future, they will do away with dirty cash and go to digital trash as we call it. That means the banksters are going to say &#x201C;we&#x2019;re not going to go with dollars or coin currencies anymore, we&#x2019;re going completely digital.&#x201D; It&#x2019;s the digital world, it&#x2019;s the metaverse world. They are not going to want any competition. That to me is going to be the rough part of cryptos, when governments go that way.</p>
<blockquote><p>When that happens, I don&#x2019;t know. Will it happen? I&#x2019;d bet my life on it. Because when they go digital they will know about every penny that you spend, where you spent it, and what you spent it on. Because the politicians and the little bureaucraps, they never work a day in their lives. They need the tax money. So when they go digital, they get every penny that they want, so they don&#x2019;t have to work and the &#x2018;Bigs&#x2019; can keep telling you what to do.</p></blockquote>
<p>Right now they don&#x2019;t have the skills and know-how at this point to go fully digital. You can look at what happened in China with the digital yuan. They did a lot of testing in Shanghai and gave the people millions of dollars to go digital. For some reason or another, it&#x2019;s going on now for two years. It didn&#x2019;t happen. This was after they announced that they were going to create the digital yuan. By the way, that&#x2019;s the way we&#x2019;ve become. It&#x2019;s the Chinese way, you will obey. Go back to the Covid War. When was it launched? Chinese Lunar New Year in 2020, the Year of the Rat. Why did they launch it? Well, I used to be on Hong Kong TV in 2019. The city of 7.5 million people and a million at one time took to the streets and protested China taking over and robbing them of their rights.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;d be talking on a break with the reporter and I said &#x201C;What&#x2019;s going on over there?&#x201D; He said &#x201C;Mr. Celente, we&#x2019;re not stopping. We&#x2019;re not going to keep letting the Chinese keep taking our freedom and rights away. We&#x2019;re going to keep protesting.&#x201D; Then let&#x2019;s go back to 2020, the Year of the Rat, China was the first one to lock down.</p>
<blockquote><p>And who did they lockdown? Hong Kong and they can&#x2019;t protest anymore. &#x2018;Oh and we&#x2019;re passing a security act, and now we&#x2019;re taking it over.&#x2019; The Chinese wore masks because of pollution and the dictates, then masks became the Western way&#x2026; Italy was the first one to follow. Locking down the people, forcing them to get vaccinated, putting masks on them, and taking their freedoms away. Then one country after another followed.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>BCN: What do you think about the Great Reset?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GC:</strong> They want total control. Go back to the markets in 2020 when they should have crashed but instead, they brought interest rates to negative and zero. Look at your merger and acquisition activity in 2021. The highest on record. Every week we do an article in the Trends Journal about the &#x2018;Bigs&#x2019; getting bigger. They&#x2019;ve been doing it for a long time. It&#x2019;s the powerful that are in control &#x2014; the money junkies and they buy out the politicians.</p>

<p>I was the assistant to the secretary of the New York Senate at 26 years old. I was at the top, and I saw what a freak show it is and what a bunch of low-life scum politicians are. Little pieces of sh**&#x2026; Arrogant boys and arrogant girls. Again, they never worked a day in their lives. They get paid off by the &#x2018;Bigs&#x2019; to do what they are told. They want total control. If we don&#x2019;t have a movement for the people, we&#x2019;re finished.</p>
<blockquote><p>We&#x2019;ve become plantation workers on the plantation of Slavelandia. It&#x2019;s better than the plantations of the old days because they used to have to house you and feed you. Now they pay you just enough money for you to feed yourself, and live on the street, they could care less. &#x2018;Just come back to work when we need you and get the hell outta here when we don&#x2019;t.&#x2019; It&#x2019;s a new plantation system.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>BCN: What would you say to people who want to protect their wealth with the way the world is today? Is there any hope or opportunities for citizens going forward?</strong></p>
<p><strong>GC:</strong> First off, that last word you said about &#x201C;hope.&#x201D; The word &#x201C;hope,&#x201D; is the most negative word in the metaphysical dictionary. It means that you want something and hope it happens without doing anything. To prove the total bullsh** of the word hope &#x2014; let&#x2019;s go back to the 2008 American election, where they elected a black president, Barack Obama &#x2014; the Nobel piece of crap prize winner, who had the campaign slogan &#x201C;Hope and Change, you can believe in.&#x201D; Hope? That arrogant lying piece of crap, he got in and did the Afghan troop surge. &#x201C;I want that guy Gaddafi out of there! Assad must go! We don&#x2019;t care if we kill 630,000 Syrians, I want him outta there! I don&#x2019;t care about Gaddafi, I don&#x2019;t care about Libya being the richest country in Africa. Where people had more rights and benefits. I want him outta there &#x2014; I want that oil!&#x201D;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#x2018;Hope?&#x2019; People have to make it happen themselves. If people don&#x2019;t get in the best shape they can physically, mentally, and spiritually &#x2014; We are at the end of the world. World War III has begun &#x2014; It&#x2019;s not a proxy war, NATO and America are at war with Russia. It won&#x2019;t become official until maybe a nuclear weapon goes off or some city is destroyed. If the people don&#x2019;t unite for peace and freedom we are finished. It&#x2019;s over.</p></blockquote>
<p>World War I and II are not ancient history, and at the time the people didn&#x2019;t stand up to fight and stop it, they simply swallowed the bullsh**. These wars just started instantly as they say in government schools or public schools&#x2026; they are sh** schools. They teach how World War I began, to boys and girls, and explain when Archduke Ferdinand was assassinated in Sarajevo. Who the f*** is this Archduke and what the f*** is Sarajevo? Do you mean it wasn&#x2019;t going on before that? &#x201C;Oh no, World War II began when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor,&#x201D; they say. Oh you mean it wasn&#x2019;t because the United States shut off all the oil and all the other sh** that was going on. &#x201C;Oh no, no, no&#x2026; it only happened on that specific day.&#x201D; That&#x2019;s the crap they will feed us when World War III begins&#x2026; It&#x2019;s begun.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-535519 size-full" title="Trend Forecaster Gerald Celente Says World War 3 Has Begun &#x2014; &#x2018;If the People Don&#x2019;t Unite for Peace, We Are Finished&#x2019;" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/napoleanssd.jpg" alt="Trend Forecaster Gerald Celente Says World War 3 Has Begun &#x2014; &#x2018;If the People Don&#x2019;t Unite for Peace, We Are Finished&#x2019;" width="1280" height="720"></p>
<p>This will be the war when they asked Albert Einstein about the kind of weapons that will be used during the third world war&#x2026; A cat that knew a thing or two about the atom bomb. He said, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know but they will be using sticks and stones to fight the fourth.&#x201D; So what should people do? I&#x2019;m fighting. I&#x2019;m having a big peace rally on July 23 in Kingston New York on the four corners of freedom. I launched <a href="https://occupypeace.com">occupypeace.com</a> back in 2014. So I am fighting for peace. I&#x2019;m doing everything I can. On the financial end, I don&#x2019;t give financial advice, but I&#x2019;m a trends forecaster. To me, gold is number one. Silver is number two and bitcoin is number three. In assets to consider. The bottom line is guns, gold and a getaway plan, GC&#x2019;s three Gs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="696" height="392" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-2022-07-09-090853.jpg" class="attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image" alt="Tether Liquidates Celsius Bitcoin Loan — &#039;Position Has Been Liquidated With No Losses&#039; to the Company" loading="lazy" style="float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;" /><p><strong>On July 8, 2022, the company behind the largest stablecoin in the world, Tether, revealed that the firm liquidated a loan made to the crypto lender Celsius, and the liquidation caused &#x201C;no losses to Tether.&#x201D; According to the stablecoin issuer, the bitcoin loan to Celsius was &#x201C;overcollateralized&#x201D; by roughly &#x201C;130%+.&#x201D;</strong></p>
<h2>Tether Liquidates Bitcoin Loan Taken out by Celsius &#x2014; Stablecoin Issuer Stresses It Will &#x2018;Never Put the Integrity of Its Reserves at Risk&#x2019;</h2>
<p>The company <a href="https://tether.to/en/">Tether</a> has <a href="https://tether.to/en/tether-discloses-celsius-loan-liquidation-process/">informed the public</a> that the firm &#x201C;has never and will never put the integrity of its reserves at risk.&#x201D; Tether noted on Friday that it did have an investment in <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/celsius-stories-littered-with-people-familiar-with-the-matter-sources-report-claims-lender-struggles-with-arguments-over-bankruptcy/">Celsius</a>, the embattled crypto lender, but the investment was &#x201C;a minimal part of its shareholder&#x2019;s equity.&#x201D;</p>
<p>A loan denominated in bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) was taken out by <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-goldman-sachs-looks-to-buy-distressed-assets-from-celsius-crypto-lender-seeks-restructuring-advice/">Celsius</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/tether-launches-stablecoin-pegged-to-the-british-pound-sterling/">Tether</a> said the loan was overcollateralized by more than 130%. &#x201C;The decision to liquidate the collateral to cover the loan was a part of the original terms of the agreement between the two entities and reconfirmed in writing before the start of the liquidation event,&#x201D; Tether detailed. The stablecoin issuer added:</p>
<blockquote><p>This process was carried out in a way to minimise as much as possible any impact on the markets and in fact, once the loan was covered, Tether returned the remaining part to Celsius as per its agreement. Celsius position has been liquidated with no losses to Tether.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Stablecoin Issuer Says Tether Critics &#x2018;Have No Understanding of How Lending, Borrowing, and Risk Management Work&#x2019;</h2>
<p>The company&#x2019;s blog post added that Tether leverages risk management processes and the firm states that &#x201C;while the media, critics, and community were wrongly fixated on Tether, other lenders including notable names in the space were blatantly providing lending facilities with nearly zero collateral.&#x201D; Those kinds of lending practices go against the ethos of Tether and the company&#x2019;s &#x201C;strict regulatory practice.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, during the last few weeks, a great number of crypto businesses have shown that they were exposed to firms like Celsius and the crypto firm Three Arrows Capital (3AC). The founder of Keyfi is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/keyfi-founder-sues-celsius-says-crypto-lenders-entire-portfolio-had-naked-exposure-to-the-market/">suing Celsius</a>, as the NFT whale also known as &#x201C;0xb1,&#x201D; has accused the company of being a &#x201C;Ponzi scheme,&#x201D; and allegedly allowed its entire portfolio to have &#x201C;naked exposure to the market.&#x201D;</p>
<p>It was further reported this week that Blockchain.com <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-blockchain-com-ceo-reveals-company-lost-270-million-from-3ac-exposure/">lost $270 million</a> from 3AC exposure and crypto companies like <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/tsx-listed-voyager-digital-temporarily-suspends-trading-deposits-and-withdrawals/">Voyager Digital</a>, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/blockfi-ceo-says-ftx-has-an-option-to-acquire-crypto-lender-at-a-price-of-up-to-240m/">Blockfi</a>, Babel Finance, and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-lender-vauld-suspends-withdrawals-company-is-discussing-restructuring-options-with-advisors/">Vauld</a> were all affected by 3AC&#x2019;s financial issues.</p>
<p>Today, stablecoins have an aggregate market capitalization of around $154 billion, and $65.9 billion worth of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a> is managed by Tether. During the past 24 hours, there&#x2019;s been $100 billion in global trade volume across crypto markets, and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a> commands $66.6 billion of that volume.</p>
<p>Tether&#x2019;s blog post about the Celsius bitcoin loan highlights how the company has been vilified by critics over rumors and speculation. &#x201C;Critics who make claims of Tether&#x2019;s inconsistencies clearly have no understanding of how lending, borrowing, and risk management work,&#x201D; Tether&#x2019;s blog post on Friday concludes.</p>

These include much higher fines for those minting digital currencies with subsidized electricity and penalties for government officials involved in mining.</strong></p>
<h2>Tavanir Raises Fines for Illegal Cryptocurrency Mining</h2>
<p>The Iran Power Generation, Transmission and Distribution Company (Tavanir) has adopted new, more severe measures to prevent crypto mining outside the law. The utility&#x2019;s spokesman Mostafa Rajabi Mashhadi announced that fines for illegal activities in the sector have been increased by 400%. Quoted by the English-language Iranian edition Financial Tribune, he elaborated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Unlicensed crypto miners must pay their electricity bills at rates four times higher than export rates that are already higher than the subsidized tariffs for households.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mashhadi also said that first-time offenders will be denied access to subsidized energy, including electricity, natural gas and liquid fuels, for a period of three months after they are identified. And those that are caught again will be cut off from supply for a full year, the official added in a statement published on the website of the Iranian Ministry of Energy.</p>
<p>If crypto mining is detected at facilities owned by state-run organizations or public institutions, those responsible will face penalties under the law and will be suspended from their government jobs in the Islamic Republic, the report also revealed.</p>
<p>Just like last year, the government in Tehran has decided to restrict crypto mining, expecting the power deficit to increase during the hot months of the year when consumption for cooling rises. In June, Tavanir ordered licensed miners to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/iran-to-shut-down-crypto-mining-farms-amid-record-high-power-demand/">halt operations</a> until the end of this summer. The seasonal ban sparked <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/mining-ban-sparks-negative-reactions-from-irans-crypto-community/">negative reactions</a> from the local crypto community.</p>

<p>In 2021, electricity shortages and frequent blackouts were partially blamed on the increased power usage for mining &#x2014; both legal and illegal &#x2014; and last May licensed miners were ordered to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/iran-to-shut-down-licensed-crypto-miners-in-peak-hours-of-power-consumption/">shut down</a>. They were allowed to resume operations in September, but then again <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/iran-orders-crypto-miners-to-halt-operations-to-prevent-winter-blackouts/">told</a> to unplug their hardware as the cold winter months increased demand for heating.</p>
<p>Iran legalized cryptocurrency mining as an industrial activity in July 2019. Since then, dozens of companies have applied for a license from the Ministry of Industry and started minting coins with the low-cost energy offered by Iranian power plants.</p>
<p>However, as the electricity sold to households is much cheaper, many Iranians have set up improvised mining installations, increasing the load for the power generation industry. Iranian authorities have been going after these miners and, according to a report published in May, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/number-of-busted-illegal-crypto-mining-farms-in-iran-nears-7000/">busted</a> almost 7,000 underground crypto farms.</p>

The majority of the cryptocurrency top 100 was marginally lower, as traders seemingly consolidated their gains from this week&#x2019;s action.</b></p>
<h2>Cosmos (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ATOM" target="_blank">ATOM</a>)</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After almost ten consecutive sessions of higher highs, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ATOM" target="_blank">ATOM</a> was consolidating to start the weekend, as traders seemingly secured gains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The token rose to an intraday top of $9.34 to start the weekend, as bulls continue to move towards the $10 mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saturday&#x2019;s moves comes less than a day from prices trading at a low of $8.93, to now on the cusp of a potential breakout.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last three weeks <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ATOM" target="_blank">ATOM</a>/USD has almost doubled in value, climbing from a floor of $5.48 on June 18, to its current point today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This rally came following a crossover of the 10-day and 25-day moving averages (MA), respectively, which enticed traders to take long positions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, with the RSI now running into a wall at its 58.38 point, some of this momentum may slow, with traders instead taking profits, rather than maintaining open positions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<h2>Polkadot (DOT)</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following a slow start to the day, DOT shook off market uncertainty to marginally rise during today&#x2019;s session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DOT/USD surged to a peak of $7.35 to start the weekend, which follows on from a low of $6.97 on Friday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today&#x2019;s action now sees DOT moving closer to a ceiling of $7.50, a point it has not broken in the last ten days.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whilst prices have consolidated below this ceiling since June 29, price strength also remains under a resistance point &#x2014; one that has been in place for over three months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 14-day Relative Strength Index is currently tracking at 45.10, which is below the ceiling of 46.90, which hasn&#x2019;t been broken since April 5.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite this, DOT has climbed by nearly 7% in the last week, leading the 10-day MA to near a possible cross with its 25-day counterpart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Providing this occurs, not only could prices climb above $7.50, but we may see bulls target the $8.50 mark. </span></p>
<p><b><i>Could we see DOT climb to as high as $10 during the month of July? Let us know your thoughts in the comments.</i></b></p>
